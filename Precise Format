/* In many cases, dividing two numbers can contain an excessive number of decimal places. In this problem, your task is to compute the division of two floating-point numbers and format the result to a specific precision.
You are given two floating-point numbers a and b. Your task is to:

Output the exact result of a / b.
Format and output the result of a / b rounded to three decimal places.
You may use System.out.format() to format the output.

You need to return an ArrayList with two values:

The first value is the exact result of a / b.
The second value is the result rounded to three decimal places.*/


import java.util.ArrayList;

class Solution {
    // Function to return an ArrayList with exact result and formatted result
    static ArrayList<Float> divisionWithPrecision(float a, float b) {
        ArrayList<Float> resultList = new ArrayList<>();

        float exact = a / b;

        // Round to 3 decimal places
        float rounded = Math.round(exact * 1000f) / 1000f;

        // Add both results to list
        resultList.add(exact);   // exact result (e.g., 2.0467393)
        resultList.add(rounded); // rounded result (e.g., 2.047)

        return resultList;
    }
}
